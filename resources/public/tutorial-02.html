<h1>Baked Garlic</h1>
<p class="indent transform-capitalize">Garlic may be known for being a little bit <em>stinky</em>, but
baked it is absolutely <span class="hilite">delicious</span> and as long as you feed it to
all of your guests no-one will complain about the smell! Once
baked the garlic becomes creamy and sweet making an ideal spread
to accompany cheese.</p>

<p class="centered transform-uppercase">Its close relatives include the onion, shallot, leek, chive, and rakkyo. With a history of human use of over 7,000 years, garlic is native to central Asia, and has long been a staple in the Mediterranean region, as well as a frequent seasoning in Asia, Africa, and Europe. It was known to Ancient Egyptians, and has been used for both culinary and medicinal purposes</p>
