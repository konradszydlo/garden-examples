      <div id="margin-and-padding">
        <p>This paragraph should be displayed in the default style of the browser with a background color and border in order that we can see where it starts and ends.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph that has the default browser style so we can see how the spacing between the paragraph displays when no margin or padding has been applied.</p>
        <p class="margin-test">This paragraph has 2em margin applied usign CSS. The margin creates additional space on the outside of the element. Therefore the space between the border and the text is unchanged. but the space between this paragraph and the edge of the viewport and Other paragraph is increased.</p>
        <p class="padding-test">This paragraph has 2em of padding applied
          using CSS. The padding creates additional space on the inside
          of the element.</p>
